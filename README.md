Maven "Just In Time" artifact-from-source "repository"

Initial work on having unknown artifacts resolved when needed based
on my ideas on Maven failing as a javac cache (to be written).

dsmp was an exact copy of the Dead Simple Maven Proxy source as
downloaded from http://www.pdark.de/dsmp/downloads.html to tinker
with.
